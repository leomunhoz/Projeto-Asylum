You should have only 3 settings modes (low, medium, high)
Game quality settin's script will choose based on index : 
0 = Low
1 = Medium
2 = High

You can see the settings I used for Mobile  in images that are in the "Settings" folder

Note: You can customize these settings. For example, change the distance of the shadows.
 Or turn on Vsync ...
